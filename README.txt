This is a slightly improved syntax file for editing manual pages in Vim.
The default syntax man.vim syntax file in Vim is rather lackluster and
strangely doesn't use the nroff.vim syntax file as a base.

This syntax file attempts to make manual page editing in Vim a little bit nicer
on the eyes. The manpage 'man.vim.man' has more details.
